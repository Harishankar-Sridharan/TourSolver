### 5. Productivity Tips

Here are some helpful tips to make your experience with **[OptimizeyourDeliveries]** smooth and efficient:

*   ⏳ **Tip: Be Patient with Large Jobs:** If you have many deliveries that need optimization, the process may take longer than expected. This is normal because the system is performing complex calculations.
*   ✅ **Tip: Check Results Early:** You don't always have to wait for the entire process to finish. If you need a preliminary result quickly, you can click **Stop and see the result** at any time during the calculation.
*   🎉 **Success Confirmation:** Once the system confirms that "The deliveries have been optimized successfully," you know your new routes are ready to implement.
