This guide will help you easily share your optimized delivery routes, called "tours," with your mobile users so they can access the routes on their mobile app. By following these simple steps, you can ensure that your drivers or field staff receive their planned daily tasks efficiently.

## 1. Introduction: Sharing Your Optimized Routes

This guide walks you through the process of exporting a planned route ("tool" or "tour") from the desktop system directly to the mobile application used by your field team. This process ensures mobile users receive an email or SMS notification containing the shared tour and its associated deliveries.

## 2. Getting Started Section

To successfully share a tour, you must first access the optimization section and select a completed route.

### System Requirements & Installation/Setup
The sources focus on the process of *sharing* the tour, not on the initial setup of the mobile application itself. However, the sharing process initiates the notification for the mobile user.

| Account Type | Notification Sent | Content Sent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trial Version** | SMS notification | Link to download the mobile application |
| **Subscribed Version** | Notification Email | Notification to all selected mobile app users that the tour has been shared |

### Initial Configuration: Understanding Notifications

When you share the tour, the system handles notification delivery based on your account status:

## 3. Feature Explanations with Benefits

The **Share with the Mobile App** feature is crucial for connecting your planning efforts with real-world execution.

*   **Benefit 1: Seamless Route Transfer:** Easily transfer complex, optimized routes (tours) directly to the mobile device where they are needed.
*   **Benefit 2: Date-Specific Sharing:** You can control the exact date range for which the tour is active and accessible on the mobile app. Sharing a tour for a specific date range (e.g., 1 day duration) confirms exactly which deliveries should be performed on the selected date(s).
*   **Benefit 3: Confirmation Feedback:** The system provides clear feedback regarding how many deliveries are being shared and how many notifications are being sent to mobile users.

## 5. Productivity Tips

Here are a few tips to help you manage your tour sharing efficiently:

*   **Tip: Check Your Account Status:** Keep in mind that the action taken after clicking **validate** differs slightly depending on whether you are running a trial version (SMS link for download) or a subscribed version (email notification). This is important for telling your field team where to look for their route information!

*   **Tip: Short Segments for Visual Guides (GIF Reference):** If you need to create short visual aids for quick training, focus on these powerful 7-second segments:
    *   **Selecting and Exporting:** `0:15–0:31` (Choosing the tool and selecting **share with the mobile app**).
    *   **Date Validation:** `0:57–1:06` (Entering the date and clicking **validate**).
    *   **Final Sending Confirmation:** `1:25–1:43` (Clicking **send** and reviewing the delivery count notification).

*   **Tip: Verify Delivery Counts:** Always pay close attention to the final notification that appears when you click **send** in Step 9. This message confirms exactly how many deliveries are included in the tour you are sharing and how many emails are being sent to your mobile users.
