## 2. Feature Explanations and Context

Creating a resource involves filling out several tabs that define how your staff member operates, travels, and when they are available.

*   **Resource Details (General Info):** This is where you identify the staff member by name and specify their starting point, known as the **departure location**.
*   **Vehicles Tab:** Here you define the primary way the staff member travels by selecting the **means of transportation**.
*   **Vehicles Capacities Tab:** This section is crucial for defining what the resource (or their assigned vehicle) can carry. You can **add vehicle capacities** to ensure constraints are met during planning.
*   **Working Time and Planning Tabs:** These sections define the staff member's availability, including selecting whether the **automatic start time** feature is active, defining specific work slots, and scheduling **lunch breaks**.
*   **Days Off Tab:** This allows you to schedule specific dates when the resource will be unavailable.

💡 **Tip:** If you are ever unsure about a specific field or constraint while entering details, you can **hover over the tool tip icons** for clarification. Each tool tip provides a short explanation of what that constraint controls.
