# Comprehensive Guide: Modifying Resources and Constraints

## 1. Friendly Introduction

Welcome to your guide for efficiently managing and updating your delivery resources and their key restrictions, or "constraints". Knowing how to modify a resource—whether it's adjusting a team's availability or changing an individual's vehicle capacity—is essential for smooth operations. In this guide, you will learn exactly how to change scheduling, locations, and capacities quickly and successfully.

## 2. Getting Started

The sources focus exclusively on the modification process itself. Information regarding specific system requirements, initial installation, or general setup steps is not included in the provided materials.

### **Accessing the Resource Management Area**

You can start modifying resources and constraints directly from the system’s homepage.

**Step 1: Access My Deliverers**

![GIF at 0:07–0:11](../../images/ResourceandVehicleManagement-ModifyingaResourceandAssociatedConstraints_timestamp_0_to_07–0_to_11.gif "From the home page – tap on My Deliverers")


**Step 2: Choose Your Modification Method**
You have two primary ways to modify a resource: **team-wise** (affecting a group) or **individually**.

| Modification Type | Access Method | Source Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

![GIF at 0:15–0:20](../../images/ResourceandVehicleManagement-ModifyingaResourceandAssociatedConstraints_timestamp_0_to_15–0_to_20.gif "To modify the resource team-wise – tap on Any Deliverer |")

Once you select a resource, you can start modifying the associated constraints.

## 3. Feature Explanations and Benefits

The constraints are the rules that govern when, where, and how a resource operates. Here are the commonly used constraints explained:

*   **Departure and Arrival Location:** This setting defines the start and end point of the resource's day. Modifying these locations is crucial if a resource's typical starting or ending address changes (e.g., if they are working from a different depot or returning home).
*   **Vehicle Capacities:** This allows you to set limits on the vehicle's capacity, typically measured by weight. This ensures that your delivery vehicle is never overloaded, which helps with safe and compliant routing. You can set the weight value in **kilograms (kg)** or **grams (g)**.
*   **Planning (Work Slots):** This determines the resource's working availability. You can manage exact start and end times, and specify which days of the week they are available.

> ⓘ **Tip:** The video focuses on commonly used constraints. To learn more about any other constraints, please refer to the constraint documentation.

## 4. Common Tasks: Detailed Modification Steps

Once you have accessed the constraint modification screen (using the pencil icon), follow the steps below to update specific resource details.

### 4.1. Modifying Departure and Arrival Locations

If a resource's start or end point changes, you can update it here.

1.  **Locate the Address:** To modify the departure or arrival location in general, look for the relevant section (Departure Location or Arrival Location).

![GIF at 0:51–1:00](../../images/ResourceandVehicleManagement-ModifyingaResourceandAssociatedConstraints_timestamp_0_to_51–1_to_00.gif "To modify the departure location and arrival location in general – tap on the pencil icon in the departure location")

3.  **Update Address:** Modify the departure address as needed.

![GIF at 1:12–1:18](../../images/ResourceandVehicleManagement-ModifyingaResourceandAssociatedConstraints_timestamp_1_to_12–1_to_18.gif "To modify the arrival location – tap on the pencil icon in the arrival location")

5.  **Update Address:** Modify the arrival location.

> *Visual Guidance Placeholder:* After modification, you will see the differences on the map. The color used will be different for the departure and the arrival locations (e.g., green or red).

### 4.2. Updating Vehicle Capacities (Weight)

You can manage the maximum weight a resource's vehicle can carry.


![GIF at 1:40–1:43](../../images/ResourceandVehicleManagement-ModifyingaResourceandAssociatedConstraints_timestamp_1_to_40–1_to_43.gif "Tap on the Vehicle Capacities")

2.  **Modify Value:** Modify the value of the weight. You can input this value in **kilograms** or **grams**.

![GIF at 1:53–2:01](../../images/ResourceandVehicleManagement-ModifyingaResourceandAssociatedConstraints_timestamp_1_to_53–2_to_01.gif "If you wish to delete any value – you can go ahead and tap the delete icon located at the right side of the weight.")


### 4.3. Modifying Planning and Work Times

The Planning section controls when your resource is available to work. There are two methods for modifying work times: **Simple View** and **Advanced View**.

#### **Simple View (Same Schedule Every Day)**

Use Simple View if the work hours are the same across all working days.

1.  **Access Planning:** Tap on **Planning**.
2.  **Access Time Slot:** In Simple View, tap on the **time slot**.
3.  **Edit Work Slot:** Tap on **Edit Workslot**.
4.  **Set Start and End Times:** Modify the start time and the end time.
5.  **Confirm:** Tap on **Edit**.

#### **Advanced View (Different Schedules for Different Days)**

Use Advanced View if you need to set unique start and end times for specific workdays.

1.  **Access Planning:** Tap on **Planning**.
2.  **Select Work Days:** In Advanced View, you can modify "work days" (e.g., work day 1, work day 2, etc.). You can specify a range, such as **1 to 5**, which represents Monday to Friday. You can also input specific days like **1, 2, 3, 4, 5**.

![GIF at 3:33–3:43](../../images/ResourceandVehicleManagement-ModifyingaResourceandAssociatedConstraints_timestamp_3_to_33–3_to_43.gif "In order to edit the timing – tap the clock icon next to the time")

4.  **Make Adjustments:** The clock image will display, allowing you to make your adjustments.
5.  **Confirm Timing:** After doing the modification inside the clock, tap **OK**.

### 4.4. Saving All Modifications

Once you have completed all necessary changes across Departure, Arrival, Capacity, and Planning:


![GIF at 3:53–3:58](../../images/ResourceandVehicleManagement-ModifyingaResourceandAssociatedConstraints_timestamp_3_to_53–3_to_58.gif "Once you complete all the modification – tap on Save")

## 5. Productivity Tips

To help you get the most out of resource management:

*   **Understand the View Difference:** This is a crucial distinction!
    *   In **Simple View**, you can *only* modify the same timings for all days.
    *   In **Advanced View**, you can modify different, unique timings for Work Day 1, Work Day 2, Work Day 3, and Work Day 4.
*   **Efficient Time Editing:** Use the clock icon next to the time to quickly bring up the clock image and make precise time adjustments.
*   **Quick Deletion:** If you need to remove a specific vehicle capacity value, look immediately to the right side of the weight entry for the **delete icon**.
