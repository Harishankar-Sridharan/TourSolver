## 5. Productivity Tips

💡 **Tip: Immediate Verification is Key**
After saving your renamed quantity, take a moment to immediately verify the change both in **Vehicle Capacities** (Task 4.2) and by checking a pending delivery import (Task 4.3). This ensures your changes propagated correctly across the system.

💡 **Tip: Keep it Simple**
Use clear, concise names that are easy for everyone on your team to understand. Since the new name will be displayed in multiple areas, choosing accessible language prevents confusion.

⚠️ **Warning: Ensure Complete Renaming**
The source indicates you can "rename the quantity" (singular). Ensure you have updated all necessary fields before tapping **Save** (0:31) to avoid having to return to the customization menu multiple times.
